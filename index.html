        <p>
          I am a UX designer interested in creating user-centric and inclusive products. I‚Äôm currently a graduate student in the Human-Computer Interaction program at the University of Maryland. I expect to graduate in the spring of 2024. My goal is to build delightful and accessible products for users with diverse backgrounds. I am also a keen observer of art, human rights, gender equality, and sustainable fashion. Feel free to connect at ziyiyuan914@gmail.com.

        <h2>Background in social science and graphic design</h2>
        <p> 
          Before joining the UX design world, I studied journalism and graphic design at American University in DC has provided me with diverse skills and knowledge that can be applied to various fields, including UX design. As a reporter, I have likely developed a keen sense of storytelling, research, and communication skills, which are essential for understanding user needs and designing user-centric experiences. Additionally, my experience in graphic design has given me a foundation in visual communication, typography, and layout, which are key elements in creating effective and visually appealing interfaces.
